      <description>Disclaimer: The following setup is for personal distribution purposes only. If you have a TV tuner a TV license must be held.
Live TV isn&amp;rsquo;t often used in my household as most of the content we consume is via streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime). I wanted a selection of Live TV to be available for those moments when we aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in committing to a 2 hour movie, season long show, or RTE were doing their yearly live broadcast of the late late Toy Show and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to rely on their ever failing web player.</description>
