      <description>In previous posts I discussed Live TV distribution, Smart Lighting and Smart Heating and Hot Water systems. Continuing with that theme, this post explores the journey of motorising roller blinds and making them &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo;.
The requirements are similar to the previous posts:
 There must be no internet dependency and the blinds should be able to be controlled by a local interface. The cost of it should be affordable.</description>

      <description>Lighting is core to any smart home system. The systems attempt to make it as accessible as possible; there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to search for a light switch when entering a walkway a motion sensor should take care of it, there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to have to get out of bed to switch out the light before going to sleep, there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to run around every room before leaving the house to ensure lights are off and there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to manually turn on and off your outdoor lights every night.</description>
