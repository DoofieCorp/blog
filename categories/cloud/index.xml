      <description>Many organisations look towards a multiple account strategy with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide administrative isolation between workloads, limited visibility and discoverability of workloads, isolation to minimize blast radius, management of AWS limits and cost categorisation. However, this comes at a large complexity cost, specifically around Identity Access Management (IAM).
Starting off with a single AWS account, and using a handful of IAM users and groups for access management, is usually the norm.</description>

      <description>In my previous blog post Azure bug bounty Pwning Red Hat Enterprise Linux I detailed how it was possible to get administrative access to the Red Hat Update Infrastructure consumed by Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines booted from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace image. In theory, if exploited one could have gained root access to all virtual machines consuming the repositories by releasing an updated version of a common package and waiting for virtual machines to execute yum update.</description>

      <description>TL;DR Acquired administrator level access to all of the Microsoft Azure managed Red Hat Update Infrastructure that supplies all the packages for all Red Hat Enterprise Linux instances booted from the Azure marketplace.
I was tasked with creating a machine image of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that was compliant to the Security Technical Implementation guide defined by the Department of Defense.
This machine image was to be used for both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.</description>
