      <description>In 2019, before COVID changed how we all work, I accepted a fully remote job. This move let me leave behind Dublin&amp;rsquo;s high costs. I swapped a small apartment for a house with a garden, giving me space for hobbies.&#xA;The Good Side of Remote Work Remote work freed me from long commutes and crazy rents. It gave me control over my time like never before, letting me focus on what really matters in work and life.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;ve created an automated solution for tracking Google reviews using AWS services. The best part? You can implement it yourself! Check out the full code and setup instructions on GitHub: google-review-email-processor&#xA;A small business owner came to me with a tricky problem: he needed a way to track which customers had left reviews for his business and which hadn&amp;rsquo;t. His goal was simple—avoid bothering customers who had already left a review with additional requests.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re juggling work and personal GitHub accounts, switching between them manually can get frustrating. Luckily, you can set things up so that your environment automatically switches accounts based on the project directory you&amp;rsquo;re working in. This post will show you how to configure your SSH agent with 1Password, use different GPG keys and identities, and make it all work seamlessly.&#xA;Step 1: Manage SSH Keys with 1Password 1Password’s SSH agent integration can securely manage your SSH keys so you don’t have to deal with passwords or key files every time.</description>

      <description>When my wife, Ciara, told me she wanted to start a blog, my initial reaction was, “Oh no, here we go!” I knew setting up a website could quickly become complicated, expensive, and require ongoing maintenance—something I&amp;rsquo;d rather avoid. So, what&amp;rsquo;s a guy to do?&#xA;The Classic Options: WordPress or Static Sites? The first thing that came to mind was WordPress. It’s user-friendly, which would make it easy for Ciara to manage content on her own.</description>

      <guid>http://ianduffy.ie/2022/07/11/exposing-my-desk-to-home-assistant/</guid>
      <description>I have a sit/stand desk. It has two buttons for control, one goes up, the other goes down. It connects to a control box via an RJ45 plug.&#xA;I wanted to connect the desk to Home Assistant so that I could use Alexa to move the desk up and down, to go to specific height percentages, and to connect to automations e.g. Via the Home Assistant OSX application Home Assistant is made aware if my webcam is on/off, I can use a state change to on to automatically make the desk go up to encourage me to stand during meetings.</description>

      <description>Smart heating systems enable you to control your home&amp;rsquo;s heating and hot water from more than just your boiler programmer. They provide fantastic convenience and may even result in reducing your energy costs.&#xA;While there are a vast amount of solutions on the market for achieving this, I struggled to find one that suited all my wants:&#xA;Must have a local interface for smart controls, not being able to turn on/off the heating or hot water due to an internet failure is not acceptable.</description>

      <description>Lighting is core to any smart home system. The systems attempt to make it as accessible as possible; there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to search for a light switch when entering a walkway a motion sensor should take care of it, there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to have to get out of bed to switch out the light before going to sleep, there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to run around every room before leaving the house to ensure lights are off and there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to manually turn on and off your outdoor lights every night.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: The following setup is for personal distribution purposes only. If you have a TV tuner a TV license must be held.&#xA;Live TV isn&amp;rsquo;t often used in my household as most of the content we consume is via streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime). I wanted a selection of Live TV to be available for those moments when we aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in committing to a 2 hour movie, season long show, or RTE were doing their yearly live broadcast of the late late Toy Show and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to rely on their ever failing web player.</description>

      <description>With Docker Desktop changing their licencing many folks are in need of a replacement. Nerdctl is worthy of this, combined with Lima it provides a Docker like CLI interface.&#xA;While the CLI interface mostly remains the same, a question that might arise is &amp;ldquo;How to I pull/push images from private repositories?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lima provides a linux virtual environment for nerdctl to run in. By introducing a $HOME/.docker/config.json authentication can occur as normal.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s world, it is normal to see applications running on Kubernetes and exposed with ingress nginx.&#xA;Authentication can be added to any application exposed by ingress nginx by using oauth2-proxy. Using the following annotations configures nginx&amp;rsquo;s http auth request module.&#xA;nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://oauth2-proxy-ingress/oauth2/start?rd=https://$host$request_uri$is_args$args nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: https://oauth2-proxy-ingress/oauth2/auth When a user is not authenticated, nginx will redirect them to the OAuth2 proxy, prompt for login, generate a cookie and redirect back to the application.</description>

      <description>At Kafka Summit this year, Confluent announced consumption based billing for their Kafka Cloud offering, making it the cheapest and easiest way to get a Kafka Cluster. However, due to the Kafka cluster being multi-tenanted it comes with some restrictions, ZooKeeper is not exposed and the __consumer_offsets topic is restricted, this means popular tools like Kafka Manager and Prometheus Kafka Consumer Group Exporter won&amp;rsquo;t work.&#xA;kafka_exporter comes as a nice alternative as it uses the Kafka Admin Client to access the metrics.</description>

      <description>When doing development locally it might be necessary to access the application(s) using a virtual host (vhost) and/or HTTPS. This post describes an approach to achieving this on OSX using Docker, which avoids creating a large mess on your computer.&#xA;Domain Name Systems (DNS) Domain Name Systems (DNS) are often referred to as the phonebook of the internet. People access information online through domain names, like ‘amazon.com’ or ‘rte.ie’. DNS is responsible for translating a domain name to an IP address.</description>

      <description>Many organisations look towards a multiple account strategy with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide administrative isolation between workloads, limited visibility and discoverability of workloads, isolation to minimize blast radius, management of AWS limits and cost categorisation. However, this comes at a large complexity cost, specifically around Identity Access Management (IAM).&#xA;Starting off with a single AWS account, and using a handful of IAM users and groups for access management, is usually the norm.</description>

      <description>AWS offer a managed ElasticSearch service.

      <description>In my previous blog post Azure bug bounty Pwning Red Hat Enterprise Linux I detailed how it was possible to get administrative access to the Red Hat Update Infrastructure consumed by Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines booted from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace image. In theory, if exploited one could have gained root access to all virtual machines consuming the repositories by releasing an updated version of a common package and waiting for virtual machines to execute yum update.</description>
