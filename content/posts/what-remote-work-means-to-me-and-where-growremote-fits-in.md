In 2019, before COVID changed how we all work, I accepted a fully remote job. This move let me leave behind Dublin's high costs. I swapped a small apartment for a house with a garden, giving me space for hobbies.

## The Good Side of Remote Work

Remote work freed me from long commutes and crazy rents. It gave me control over my time like never before, letting me focus on what really matters in work and life. Being able to plan my day how I want has been amazing.

## The Challenge of Remote Work

But this new freedom came with its own problems. The casual chats, shared moments, and buzz of an office were missing. In my old job, those random chats often led to unexpected achivements and personal growth.

I remember when my colleagues convinced me to join them in a 100km cycle—a challenge I would’ve never considered on my own. Their encouragement pushed me beyond my limits, and we accomplished something memorable together.

With remote work, those spontaneous experiences and that sense of community were gone. I no longer had people nearby to motivate me.

## How Grow Remote Fills That Gap

While remote work's flexibility is great, it can make you feel cut off. That's where Grow Remote comes in - creating a space where remote workers can connect, support each other, and share experiences.

Grow Remote has encouraged me to try new things, just like my old workmates did with that 100km cycle. Thanks to this lively community, I've found myself doing things I never thought I would, from jumping into the Irish Sea at dawn to organising local events for other remote workers.

## Helping Others Find Their Remote Role

One of the best parts of being involved with Grow Remote is helping others find their own path to remote work. I've seen how much freedom and flexibility it can bring, and I want to help others experience the same.

Whether it's sharing job opportunities, giving advice, or just being there to support someone's journey, Grow Remote lets us help each other and create success for everyone in the community.

## The Impact of Remote Work on Small Towns and Villages

Remote work isn't just changing individual lives - it can transform whole communities. By letting people work from anywhere, remote jobs are bringing work to small towns and villages that didn't have many options before. This can bring new life to local businesses and communities.
